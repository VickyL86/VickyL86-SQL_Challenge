# VickyL86-SQL_Challenge

Please run the code in a following order:
1. Please first run the employee_schema.sql to create tables with respective primary keys - code can be run in one piece. CSV for dept_emp had an additional column added to allow creating of the primary key.
2. Import CSVs into postgres. To avoid errors, import the data in the same order as the corresponding tables got created. 
3. Next please run the employee_relationship codes to establish necessary foreign key conditions. Please run the code in three pieces. Table ept_emp was altered to allow emp_no to become a primary key for the table.
4. Finally run the analysis.sql file for individual views - please run in pieces for each view.
